# Asahi openSUSE port details

Currently I'm working on openSUSE port for Apple Silicon machines.

## TODO list

- [ ] Boot openSUSE from USB device with pre-built (by hands) image
  - [ ] Build image
  - [ ] Test what works or not
- [ ] Prepare installer
  - [ ] Prepare OBS repos with necessary packages (kernel, m1n1, u-boot, asahi-scripts, etc.)
  - [ ] Prepare basic (with YaST starting after first boot) rootfs images (and scripts to build them)
  - [ ] Build installer (for use like general Asahi installer, ex. `curl https://ivabus.dev/suse | sh`)
  - [ ] Provide all types of openSUSE (Leap, Tumbleweed, Leap Micro, MicroOS) for installation.
  - [ ] Test every type of installation
  - [ ] Document things
  - [ ] Release
