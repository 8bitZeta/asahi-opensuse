# asahi-opensuse

This repository contains kiwi configs and rpmbuild spec files in order to install openSUSE Tumbleweed to an Apple Silicon laptop. Currently, I don't plan on releasing images and packages for installation of others as this requires commitment and dedication.

_**Please use at your own risk**_.


# Current State

I am currently running openSUSE Tumbleweed on an Apple Macbook Air M1 (2020).


# Todo

- [ ] Cleanup spec files
- [ ] Automate post-installation configs (eg. resize2fs)


# Big thanks to the following:
- ivabus - for the initial configs
- Fedora Asahi SIG Team - basis of some specs
- tpwrules / NixOS on Apple Silicon - basis of some specs
- openSUSE maintainers - basis of some specs
- Asahi Linux team - for creating Asahi Linux and other modules
